# Braze Components

A library of React components for displaying Braze messages on DCR and
frontend.

## Publishing to NPM

You'll need to be part of the @guardian NPM org. Ask someone to add you if
you're not already.

```
$ yarn publishToNPM
```

This will:

* Build the package
* Interactively ask for a new version number (and create a commit for the
  version change in package.json)
* Publish the new release to NPM
